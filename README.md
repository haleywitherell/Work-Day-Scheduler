## HTML and CSS
- The HTML and CSS files were already done for this assignment
- In the HTML I added a framewokr for creating rows in the browser, however I commented it out so I couod use JS to create the rows. 

# JS
- I used JS to set the date at the top of the page.
- I used JS to create the hourly rows where you can write comments and save them for each hour of the work day. 
- I used JS to change the color of the rows depending on what time of the day it is. 
- I used JS to allow the user to save the comments and todos the fill in for each hour.
- I used JS to save comments to the local storage so they dont go away when refreshing the page.
